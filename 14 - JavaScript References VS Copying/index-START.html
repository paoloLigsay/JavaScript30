    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    // let n = 1,

    // console.log(n, n2)
    
    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // const new_team = players

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // new_team.pop()
    // console.log(players)

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const team2 = players.slice()
    
    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players)

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players]
    const team5 = Array.from(players)
    team5.pop()
    console.log(players)

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person
    // captain.age = 99
    // console.log(person)

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const captain2 = Object.assign({}, person, { age: 22 })
    console.log(person)
    console.log(captain2)

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain3 = {...person, age: 11 }
    console.log(captain3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
    const p = {
      name: 'pao',
      age: 3,
      social: {
        twitter: '@sample'
      }
    }

    // const p2 = Object.assign({}, p)
    // p2.social.twitter = '@thisisaonthersample'
    // console.log(p)
    // console.log(p2)

    const p3 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({...p}))
    p3.social.twitter = '@anotherone'
    console.log(p)
    console.log(p3)
